# ADR 0004: Stable error codes as public API

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2026-05-11

## Context

CI pipelines, support playbooks, and programmatic wrappers need **stable identifiers** for failure modes. Ad-hoc messages change; opaque `Error` strings do not compose.

## Decision

1. Expose **stable machine codes** for Kaleido failures using the `KALEIDO_*` namespace.
2. Keep codes centralized in `KaleidoErrorCode`.
3. Document the mapping in `docs/errors.md`.
4. Tests assert error codes for public failure paths.
5. New public error codes must be prefixed before they are exposed.

## Consequences

- Breaking change for anyone parsing legacy pre-`KALEIDO_*` codes; this must be communicated in release notes.
- Enables fixture-based tests that assert on `code` fields, not full English strings.
- Makes stderr/message text easier to improve without breaking CI consumers.
