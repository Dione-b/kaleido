# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

Caatinga is a pnpm workspace managed by Turbo. Main packages live under `packages/`: `core` contains config, templates, shell orchestration, networks, and errors; `client` contains browser/Node contract-client helpers and wallet adapters; `cli` contains the `caatinga` command and handlers. Reusable templates live in `packages/templates/`. Docs and ADRs live in `docs/`. Consumer and packaging checks live in `scripts/`, with sample apps under `examples/`.

Tests are colocated with source files and use `*.test.ts`, for example `packages/core/src/config/load-config.test.ts`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

Use pnpm 9.15.4 and Node 20 or newer.

- `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`: install exactly from `pnpm-lock.yaml`; this is CI behavior.
- `pnpm build`: build all packages through Turbo.
- `pnpm test`: run all Vitest suites.
- `pnpm typecheck`: run `tsc --noEmit` across packages.
- `pnpm dev`: run the CLI from source via `tsx`.
- `pnpm knip`: detect unused files, exports, and dependencies.
- `pnpm ci:publish-matrix`: run build, tests, package snapshots, dry-run publish, and consumer checks.

For package-specific work, use filters, for example `pnpm --filter @caatinga/core test`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

This repository is TypeScript ESM-first with strict compiler settings. Keep code explicit, typed, and small. Prefer named exports for reusable library APIs. Use kebab-case for command and utility files (`load-config.ts`, `init.command.ts`) and PascalCase only for classes/types that require it (`CaatingaError.ts`). Preserve public error codes and package exports as compatibility contracts.

No formatter config is currently committed; follow the existing two-space JSON style and conventional TypeScript formatting in nearby files.

## Testing Guidelines

Vitest is the test framework. Add or update colocated `*.test.ts` files for behavior changes, especially error paths, manifests, CLI behavior, config parsing, and template compatibility. Run `pnpm test` and `pnpm typecheck` before submitting. For release-impacting changes, run `pnpm ci:publish-matrix` when feasible.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Recent history uses Conventional Commits: `fix:`, `fix(core):`, `docs:`, `test:`, and `chore:`. Keep commits scoped and imperative, for example `fix(cli): bundle templates during build`.

Pull requests should include motivation, behavior, tests, and release impact. Link issues or specs. For publish/version changes, keep each package `package.json` aligned with intended published versions and internal ranges, then update and commit `pnpm-lock.yaml`; CI uses frozen lockfile installs.

## Security & Configuration Tips

Do not commit secrets, wallet keys, private artifacts, or local `.env` files. Treat `caatinga.artifacts.json`, template manifests, exported package paths, and documented error codes as public contracts; changing them requires a compatibility note and rollback plan.
